4,Akshay,4.0 out of 5 stars,This phone is value for money and packed with all that you need out of a smart phone in this range.Battery performance is satisfactory.Cons: At timeâ€™s the touch screen does not respond quickly as time lag is experienced between a finger gesture and response from the screen.AI of the camera delivers artificial pictures.Conclusion: This is a good buying option in this range must go for it.

6,Gavin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Oppo and so I like it . It's a decent handset for an affordable price. I'm not a heavy user. So this phone does he job for me. It's comfortable in the hand and is sleek.
7,Roy_Trusted,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far it's working very nicely, fingerprint sensor is fast, camera quality is nice for me as we all know how oppo stands out incase of camera quality.Cons - idk yetPackaging was very bad not upto the mark , as u r sending a phone there should have been slight precautions taken while sending the package, it was too lose and phone box was literally moving from one side to another badly."
8,Prashant,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For reader who would to buy smartphone OPPO A15s is just a okay phone but not value for money, it could be more better cause most of the people who have trusted OPPO for there quality, battery backups & camera purpose. After using it I would like to say my honest opinions is that it has some issues like battery support for fast charging problem, Camera quality very low not well to satisfy user, some reboot issue and there other fault like in camera and videos taking."
